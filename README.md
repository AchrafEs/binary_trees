# binary_trees

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left
child and the right child. It's a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various applications
like search algorithms, expression parsing, and more. Binary trees are also the basis for more advanced data structures
like binary search trees, AVL trees, and heaps.

Here's an explanation of binary trees in the context of C programming:

```
// Structure representing a node in a binary tree
struct Node {
    int data;           // Data stored in the node
    struct Node* left;  // Pointer to the left child node
    struct Node* right; // Pointer to the right child node
};

// Function to create a new node with the given data
struct Node* createNode(int data) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->left = NULL;
    newNode->right = NULL;
    return newNode;
}

int main() {
    // Creating nodes for a binary tree
    struct Node* root = createNode(1);   // Create root node with data 1
    root->left = createNode(2);          // Attach left child with data 2
    root->right = createNode(3);         // Attach right child with data 3
    root->left->left = createNode(4);    // Attach left child's left child with data 4
    root->left->right = createNode(5);   // Attach left child's right child with data 5

    // Now the binary tree looks like this:
    //       1
    //      / \
    //     2   3
    //    / \
    //   4   5

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define a `struct Node` to represent a node in the binary tree. Each node contains an integer data
and pointers to its left and right children. The `createNode` function allocates memory for a new node, initializes its
fields, and returns a pointer to the new node.

The `main` function demonstrates the creation of a binary tree with a root node and several child nodes attached to it.
Remember that this is a basic example, and in practice, binary trees can become more complex and dynamic, requiring
additional functions for insertion, deletion, traversal, and other operations. Also, error checking and memory
management (like freeing allocated memory) are essential in real-world applications.
